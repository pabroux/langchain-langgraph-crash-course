LangChain LangGraph Crash Course (LLCC) is a hands-on course designed to teach you [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) from the ground up. In this course, you will learn how to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows, intelligent agents doing web searches, text classifiers, and much more.

> [!NOTE] 
> Unlike official tutorials, LLCC provides pure Python scripts instead of Jupyter or Colab notebooks, delivering clean, ready-to-run code. Each script is extensively commented for complete clarity and ease of understanding. Additionally, LLCC sometimes includes extra steps not found in official tutorials, such as LCEL.

- [Install](#install)
- [Cost](#cost)
- [Course](#course)
- [Resources](#resources)

## Requirements

If you want to run the examples, you will need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh)

## Install 

Inside the repository, install the dependencies as follows:
```shell
pixi install -a
```

## Cost

All examples utilize the OpenAI API, specifically employing the `gpt-4o-mini` model as the language model and/or the `text-embedding-3-large` model for embeddings. You can access these services under the free tier, which typically incurs no cost.

## Course

> [!TIP]
> It's recommended to follow the course in the given order.

|------|-------------|
| Chat models & prompts | Simple LLM application with prompt templates and chat models |
| Semantic search | Search over a PDF with document loaders, embedding models and vector stores |
| Classification | Classify text into tags using chat models with structured outputs |
| Extraction | Extract structured data from text using chat models and few-shot examples |

### 2. LangGraph

#### 2.1 Agents

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Agent | Simple agent with a memory and able to do web searches |
| Agent & human in the loop | Agent empowered to request a human intervention |
| Agent & time travel | Altering an agent output by changing its memory  |

#### 2.2 Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
